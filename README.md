# ðŸ’³ Bank Microservices Project

A Spring Boot-based microservices application that simulates a simple banking system. This project is structured into independent services for handling **Customers**, **Accounts**, and **Transactions**, secured using **JWT-based Authentication**, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, and **Password Encryption**.

---

## Project Modules

The project consists of the following microservices:

1. Customer Service (`customerservice`)
- Customer creation and management
- JWT token generation (`/authenticate`)
- Implements DTOs for request/response
- Uses Spring Security for authentication & authorization

2.  Account Service (`account-service`)
- Account creation and management
- Deposit, Withdrawal, and Fund Transfer functionality
- Validates JWT token for secure communication
- Connects with `transactionservice` to log transactions
- Implements DTOs for request/response

3.Transaction Service (`transactionservice`) 
- Stores logs of all deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers
- Accepts data from `account-service`

---

## Security Features

- JWT Authentication**: Only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.
- Password Encryption**: Uses BCryptPasswordEncoder to securely hash user passwords.
- JWT Token Validation Filter**: Validates token on every request using a `JwtRequestFilter`.
